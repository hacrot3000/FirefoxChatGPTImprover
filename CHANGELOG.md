# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to FirefoxChatImprover are documented here.

The format follows the principles of Keep a Changelog. Version numbers follow the add-on version in `extension/manifest.json`.

## [Unreleased]

### In progress

- Named saved working-session catalog: multiple named sessions, search, rename, update, duplicate, delete, typed import/export and controlled restore.

### Deferred

- Native Host for macOS is intentionally excluded from the current implementation sequence.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Search/filter controls for tabs, Configuration profiles, Monitor profiles, Target profiles, Local action profiles, command presets and per-tab command history.
- Selected items remain visible outside the active filter so filtering never changes the working selection or discards drafts.

### Release documentation hotfix

- Added `PROJECT_STATUS.md` as the release-facing inventory of completed, in-progress, planned and deferred features.
- Added generated rich release notes and documentation assets for GitHub Release publishing.

## [0.28.23] - 2026-08-05
